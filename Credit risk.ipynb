    "- Credit risk is the probability of a financial loss resulting from a borrower's **failure to repay a loan**. In other word it refers to the potential loss that a lender or investor may incur due to the failure of a borrower or counterparty **to fulfill their financial obligations**.\r\n",

    "- Likewise, Imagine you lend $500 to your friend to buy a new phone. Your friend promises to pay you back in a month. However, when the due date arrives, your friend doesn't have the money to repay you. This situation represents credit risk ,the risk that your friend won't be able to fulfill their repayment obligation, resulting in a loss for you as the lender.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- Credit risk encompasses the chance that a lender or investor may not receive the owed principal and interest due to a borrower’s inability to repay a loan also affecting the time value of money\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- IFRS 9 is an International Financial Reporting Standard issued in 2018 by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that addresses the accounting for financial instruments. It provides guidance on the classification, measurement, impairment, and hedge accounting of financial instruments, including those related to credit risk. This Standard replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments : Recognition and Measurement\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- It requires entities to use ‘Expected Credit Losses’ (ECLs) to recognize impairment losses on financial assets, while IAS 39 requires entities to use ‘Incurred Losses’. The use of ECLs allows entities to recognize losses earlier and can lead to more timely and accurate recognition of credit losses. This means that the finacial entities has to develop the models that predict the expected losses and make provisions for the losses to cater for credit risk which result from default. This made the calculation of probability of default a crucial component in the financial field.\r\n",

    "- Refers to the one of the key metric used to identify the creditworthiness of a customer. It helps us to estimate the chances that customer would make payments on time or would remain solvent during the period of mortgage.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- According to Genesis (2018) state that, the probability of default is one of the most important risk parameters estimated in credit institutions, especially banks, and plays a major role in credit risk analysis and management. Given the fact that one of the fundamental activities of banks is granting loans, the banking industry places a great deal of emphasis on credit risk. Also, the probability of default estimates should be unbiased  meaning that the best estimate PD i.e. PD should accurately predict number of defaults. However it is crucial for the financial entities to accurately come up with the correct estimates for the default probabilities to asses the chances of finacial loss so as to cushion for that. This research will implement different classifiers aganist the base line logistic regression model and compare their performance in ability to classify default client and non default client from the given retail dataset."
